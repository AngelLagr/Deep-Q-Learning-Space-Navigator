# Deep-Space-Navigator
This project explores the use of Deep Q-Learning to optimize space trajectories in a simulated solar system. The aim is to enable a rocket to leave Earth and reach a target planet (e.g. Mars) using a reinforcement-trained model.

# Description  
This project explores the use of **Deep Q-Learning** to optimize space trajectories in a simulated solar system.  
The goal is to train an agent to **launch from Earth and reach a target planet** (e.g., Mars) using reinforcement learning.

We use **Pygame** for visualization, **PyTorch** for deep learning, and a physics simulation that accounts for planetary gravity.

**Current version:** The agent is trained in a system where planets are static.  
**Final goal:** Generalizing the approach to compute **optimal trajectories in any dynamic solar system configuration**.

## Project Structure  
- **`train.py`**: Contains the training process using Deep Q-Learning.  
- **`model.pth`**: File storing the trained model weights.  
- **`load_model.py`**: Script to load a trained model and run a simulation.  
- **`performance.png`**: A graph showing the modelâ€™s performance over training episodes.  

---

## Final Objective  
The ultimate goal is to create an agent capable of computing the **optimal trajectory** between Earth and a target planet while considering the gravitational influences of celestial bodies.  
This could have practical applications in **automated space mission planning**.

## Technologies Used  
- **Python**  
- **Pygame** (visualization)  
- **PyTorch** (Deep Q-Learning)  
- **Matplotlib** (performance visualization)

## Execution  
To train the model:  
```bash
python train.py

To load your model and test it:
```bash
python load_model.py
